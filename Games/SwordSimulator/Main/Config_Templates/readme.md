this is an ordinary template that reflects the current toggles the AutoFarm.lua script offers.

if you haven't even loaded the script once and want to use the config, make a folder in the workspace directory of your executor's filesystem with the name "SwordSimData/Configs".
this would look like ".../executor_main/workspace/SwordSimData/Configs"  (executor_main is arbitrary, don't yell at me)

copy the contents of the template into a file created in the Configs folder, and name the file "Config_USERID.json", where USERID is the userid of the roblox account that the config will correspond to.
