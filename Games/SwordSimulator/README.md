## Game Link and Loadstring
- ```https://www.roblox.com/games/7026949294```
- ```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoComplement/Roblox/main/Games/SwordSimulator/Kitty.lua"))()```

## How To Whitelist
1) The faster whitelist method is the one-time purchase of the specified group t-shirt. Users are whitelisted upon purchase.
- ```https://www.roblox.com/catalog/11584258082```  

2) The more secure method is through shoppy:  
- ```Method has not been setup yet```

## Why is there a whitelist?
This script includes a whitelist because I have no intention to release it for free, public use.   
Your purchase contributes to further development of the script, and your personal access is protected by the powerful obfuscation of Luraph.

## Discord 
- Send ```loverboy#3970``` a message on discord with proof of whitelist to receive the discord link.
